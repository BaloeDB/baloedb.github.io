## Description
In this exercise I am instructed to create a service checker using flask and requests.
This service checker should periodically sent requests to the services.

I have created a first version of this application, a server that checks services one time.
But I encountered problems in making this application periodically update.

## The problem
I need to figure out how to periodically sent get requests to the services.
This does not seem to work with the current setup I have created for this application.
Now, my application is a server that returns html pages.
Client is rendered on the server-side, this is probably a bad pattern.
I am able to update data, but I am not able to update the display.

## Research so far
I have found these links that might help me in solving this problem:

## Developer notes
1. I prefer server-side over client-side client, I prefer keeping this application small.
2. I need to figure out how to make a project in a tool that I don't really know that well.
  - How much time to spent on watching tutorials?
  - How much time to spent on reading documentation?
  - How to prevent copy pasting?
3. I should continue this exercise later. Maybe try to go version first, maybe that helps me.
