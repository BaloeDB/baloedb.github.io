## Description
In this exercise I have created a service checker in python.
It periodically sents get requests to web services for their status.
The tools that I have used for this project are: flask, requests, turbo-flask and jinja.
I used html and bootstrap for the frontend.
I also needed to implement multi-threading for this exercise.

This project is not visible online yet. I will try to deploy it later.

## Objectives
This exercise has two objectives:
1. Learn how to use flask and requests to make a simple web app.
2. Learn how to periodically sent a get request to an endpoint / multi-threading.

## Resources

## Developer notes
- I have a feeling I got stuck too long in solving this exercise.
  I should have been able to complete this exercise faster.
- The biggest challenge for me is: learning how to use tools that you don't really know yet.
  How much should I read before I start making projects? How to avoid copy-pasting?
- There are many other ways I could have tackled this problem:
  * Separting client & server (ajax)
  * Figuring out how celery works
  * And many others, see further reading
- The teacher also asked to implement the same exercise using Go. A language I have never touched.
  * I should do this later. Again, the same problem: learn how to use a tool that you don't know yet.
