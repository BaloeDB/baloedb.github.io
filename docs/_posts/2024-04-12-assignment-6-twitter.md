## Description
In this exercise I had to create a twitter clone using flask.
I followed the official flask tutorial to do this.
On a different day, I will extend the tutorial, so that it actually includes my own code.
However, the result of the tutorial satisfies the requirements of this exercise.
The exercise even mentioned that a tutorial as this exists.

## Objectives
Use flask to create a twitter clone in which:
1. Users can make accounts
2. Users can create posts
3. Users can follow each other

The first two requirements have been met in this tutorial.
The third requirement should be added by myself, along the additions the tutorial mentions.

## Developer notes
- This exercise has learned me a new learning method: following a tutorial and expanding.
  I do not know what to think of this method yet.
  Following a tutorial can be quite ineffective and boring.
  However, it does teach you how a developer in that language thinks.
  And provides you with a project stub that you can use in different projects.
- This method is probably fine, there is reason why the official documentation provides a tutorial.
  Learn by example, and then do it yourself.
  Struggling is key in learning, so following tutorials should be a small part of your learning process.
- I really should spend another day on this project atleast to make it my own.
  And should probably make a project in a different domain to prove that myself that I have learned
  how to use Flask.
- I would like to deploy this app someday, but it should be my own code.
  Can not add something to my portfolio that is mostly created by someone else.
- I did use vim in this project. So I probably got more familar with it.
