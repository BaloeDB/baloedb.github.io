## Description
In this exercise I had to create a custom desktop using Openbox.
Openbox is a free, stacking window manager for the X Window System, licensed under the GNU General Public License. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Openbox]

## Objectives
This exercise has multiple objectives:
1. Learn how to use openbox
2. Learn how to configure openbox
3. Learn how to tinker

# Outcome
I created a simple desktop. It does not have many features:
1. Taskbar
2. Background
3. Customized menu & keybinds
4. Theming & Fonts
5. Determine display script

I downloaded a couple apps to manage my openbox configuration:
1. ObMenu
2. ObConf

## Future
Learning how to tinker is a difficult subject for me.
I find myself satisfied with the most basic of desktops.
Same as for text editors, if I can just type text, it doesn't really matter to me
that much that I don't have access to smart shortcuts.

I wish I could improve these skills. But the learning curve is hard.
Expanding my desktop is the same as learning vim, I just have to do it.
But it costs time, and I might not like it that much.
It falls into the category of quality of life improvements, and I don't really prioritize that.

## Notes
- Openbox is a mature system. It seems outdated, but people still use it. 
Openbox calls itself feature complete, and it seems to have the authority for that statement.
- There are lots of different window managers. i3 and KWin seem to be major competitors.
- Tinkering is fun, but not for me? I hope on day it is.
