## Description
In this exercise I had to create a twitter clone using flask.
I have been working on this assignment three days now, and I think it is time to move on.
I was able to add my own features to the project, like buttons and my own style.
I learned how to tackle a similiar problem to this the next time:

Use official documentation, if they have a starter project, use it, and expand on it yourself.
Try to keep momentum. Keep moving forward.

I am not entirely satisfied with my result on this assignment, but it is not that bad.
Next time, I will just do it better.

## Objectives
Create a twitter clone with the following features:
1. Posts
2. Comments
3. Likes
4. Profiles
5. Follow

## Resources
I learned the merits of using official documentation in this process.
I really tried to use only those resources.

For this project, you need access to:
1. https://getbootstrap.com/
2. https://flask.palletsprojects.com/
3. https://www.sqlite.org/
4. https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/

## Developer Notes
- I am still not sure about using vim. I think it is slowing me down at the moment.
- I really hope I will be more satisfied with the outcome of the next assignment.
  Learning is failing, and I think that I failed on this exercise.
- Flask is a nice tool. I think I am now able to build projects in it, so I definitely look forward
  doing that a next time, but then better.
- Sqlite official docs is quite hard to read, what to do with docs like that?
  Too technical.
