## Description
In the last couple weeks, I studied material of Niels, one of the teachers at Itvitae.

He provided me with the following:
- a Course: networking, linux, python, shell scripting, servers, web applications
- a series of projects I had to blog about

In this blog post, I will reflect about my progress in this material, and what I will do with the time that I have left for this project.

## Subjects
I want to categorize the subjects of the materials as the following:
1. Learning about linux: arch, openbox, vim, shell scripting, 
   commands
2. Learning about networking: theory, servers, ssh, docker, ubuntu server
3. Learning about python: python, django, flask
4. Doing projects: service checker, calculator, games, twitter, markdown editor
5. Learning how to learn: blogs, research, projects, documentation, choosing resources

## Objective 1: Learning about linux
General outcome: glad that I got to use it more, wish to continue learning

I only worked in linux in this project. I am getting used to it.

I managed to customize my linux environment using openbox. I know how to solve a problem on my linux machine.

I still think that I am not that much of a power user. I find myself satisfied with lightweight setup. If I encounter a problem that is really nagging me, I will fix it. But I do not really optimize that much.

I wish to continue learning more about linux, by using it. Hands-on experience is key. Computer networking can also help improve my knowledge about linux, for example, an ubuntu server can only be controlled using a command line.

## Objective 2: Learning about networking
General outcome: nice recap, should have done more

The course started with watching a lot of videos about networking. I liked that part, but it probably did not do too much for me. It was nice to recap the knowledge I learned at my university.

I should have spent more time on this subject. I think I will make it a priority for next week, but we have to see about that. It is a subject I like to postpone on.

I did expirement with some ssh however. That was nice. If I want, I am able to control a pi using ssh.

If I want to continue with this subject, I should (again) choose a hands-on approach. Use pi or hosting platform as server, deploy things. Change things. Implement protocols.

There are also a lot of courses on this subject, or nice books, but I should be carefull in pursuing those.

Maybe I can get some certificates in this subject sometime, I will do AWS Cloud Practioner next month. This topic is a great challenge for me, and that is the exact reason why I should tackle it more.

## Objective 3: Learning about python
General outcome: nice recap, but already had enough experience in it

This was the biggest part of the descryption course. I spent a couple of days on it, made some exercises, recap my knowledge. It was fine, but probably should assume that my knowledge of python basics is fine now.

Python is a fun language to tinker with, maybe I can use it for that in the future? Data science, small scripts. Niels sugggested I should do the following project: create a python script, deploy it on your server, use docker. That is a nice project, why did I not do this?

## Objective 4: Doing projects
General outcome: built some nice things, should have spent more time

I did built some nice things during this course, but should have spent some more time on it. Now, every project feels half-completed. I want to publish them on Github, but don't think they are already ready for that.

I should have focussed on only one project, and spent more days on it. Make it something that I can be proud about.

What I did like however, is that I learned how to use new languages and frameworks without overusing tutorials. Stick to documentation, maybe one tutorial to get in the process of using the tool, but move out of it as soon as possible.

## Objective 5: Learning how to learn
General outcome: made some progress, trying to move out of tutorial hell
Really important for me, I keep getting stuck in this process.

Consuming youtube videos or internet articles is easy, but I am still of the opinion that you only really learn if you get to apply knowledge, and I believe that this is a slow process.

Choose a goal per day and really focus on that, try to prove to yourself that you made progress in that goal. That is how I wish to continue my learning journey.

I also really want to learn how to tinker and how to be passionate about the stuff you do. When I choose a project, I need to convince myself that I really want to do that project. Otherwise, I will miss out on some enjoyment of learning.

## What's next
I will meet with Niels to reflect about his courses upcoming thursday.
I will give him a positive review, he deserved it.

I am happy with some of the products of this process. This blog is really nice, I hope I will keep improving it. Learning insights were good, I hope I will not get stuck again. 

Certifications are up next. Scrum & AWS, let's see if I can study for them in a way that makes sense. Maybe I can also blog about that?

As for this course, I really wanted to do the markdown editor as a refresher for spring boot & react. It is a nice assignment, so I hope that I will do that.

I also want to tinker a little bit more with my raspberry pi, setup ubuntu server, arch, and try to do some nice things with it.

Lastly, doing a day of researching and blogging can also maybe be insightfull for me. Improving my language, improving my creativive writing (instead of recapping articles), those are some nice goals.

To summarize: I need to move on to scrum pretty quick. Maybe I can still do one nice thing for this course, but I think I should move on after that.
