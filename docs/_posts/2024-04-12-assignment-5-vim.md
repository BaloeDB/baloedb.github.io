## Description
In this exercise I had to learn how to use vim.
I got the instruction to go through to the vim tutor.
I have done this for a hour, and I think I now have enough understanding of vim to get started.
I did not complete the entire vimtutor, since it got boring after some time.

## Objectives
Learn how to use vim

## Developer notes
- It was quite boring to learn vim. The learning process is repeating a lot of key presses.
  It does not take much brainpower, just route memorization (muscle memory).
- I should however continue practice with vim. I am now able to work in vim, but I would like 
  to optimize my editing process.
- I will try to use vim in further projects. I should figure out how to configure vim for the
  languages and tools that I will use.
