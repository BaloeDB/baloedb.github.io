## Description
In this exercise I have created a calculator using JavaScript.
You can access the calculator on the following link: <a href="https://baloedb.github.io/static/calculator">Calculator</a>
I also used tailwind css in this project.

## Prerequisites
This exercise assumes basic knowledge in HTML, CSS, JS. 

## Objectives
This exercise has two objectives:
1. Create static one-page calculator app using html, js, css
2. Make this app accessible from your github pages

This exercise is a simple exercise in learning web development.

## Developer notes
- I tried to recreate this calculator design: https://www.creativefabrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/02/Simple-calculator-Graphics-33399437-1.png
- I swapped the ()-button -> parentheses,  for a R-button -> previous response.
- I could consider improving the quality of this code later, since it has some code repetition
and documentation issues.
- I still use nano as text editor, I should switch to vim later.
