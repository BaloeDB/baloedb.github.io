## Description
In this exercise I had to create a game in Defold.
I struggled with doing this in the first day, but eventually end up making pacman.
I have created a basic version of pacman, with one ghost, pacman, and yellow dots.
Pacman wins if he has collected all the dots.
Pacman loses if the ghost attacks him.
Pacman is controlled by the player, the ghost controled by ai.

## Objectives
Learn how to create a game in defold

# Outcome
I am really satisfied with the outcome. The first day I struggled alot,
but I ended up actually learning how to use this tool.

I could spent more days in Defold to enjoy that I learned it, and to expand on pacman
or maybe even make another game. But I do not think this has the highest priority.

I really hope I can repeat the learning method I used in this exercise for future projects.
It was a fast method, that mostly only relied on official documentation.
